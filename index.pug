              h3 Have You Heard Of The Byzantine Problem?
              p It's the classic scenario where the fate of a complete Army depends on the agreement between the Generals. Every General commands a batallion of troops, and their only options are retreat or attack. As long as all the Generals (or the majority) agree to one strategy, there's hope. To make matters worse, there are some Traitors present who would cast their vote selectively - agree with both the groups selectively.

              h3 Or That Most of The Big Data Systems Never Make It To Production?
              p Observability is the capability to monitor, analyse and proactively respond to events that occur at runtime in big data systems. Another factor that plays a major role is ‘Operability’ - does the organisation have the ability to operate the big data product. Operability is often termed as the Graveyard of Big Data projects!
          .section-intro__content
            p Blockchain and cryptocurreny are also based on Distributed Systems. Blockchain rather exemplifies a disritbuted computing system with high Byzantine Fault Tolerance!
            br
            p DSConf 2018 is conference dedicated to such problems! We have eminent academicians who've spent years researching such problems sharing their thoughts and approach with you. We also have distinguised engineers who've built some really large scale distributed systems talking about practical aspects of distributed systems. The talks are curated in a way to stimulate deep thinking as well has a practical approach to distributed systems.
            br
            p
              em If you like geeking out on mathematical problems or building technology for the future, this conference is a must attend!

              .section-schedule-item__right--text
                p In the last decade, since the emergence of public clouds, a hard boundary has remained between public clouds and on-premises infrastructures and services. With Azure Stack, GKE, VMWare on AWS, and recent announcements about AWS Outposts, it is clear that the line between public clouds and on-premises infrastructures and services is blurring. Recent developments in the industry, such as merger between Hadoop rivals Cloudera & Hortonworks, as well as IBM's acquisition of RedHat, indicate a trend that an exciting hybrid cloud future awaits us. Public clouds entering on-premises means same logically centralized control planes (and associated managed services) will be available on both public clouds, and on-premises, making hybrid data planes possible. In addition, software systems deployment targets, which until recently were limited to bare metal and heavyweight virtual machines, have proliferated. They now include a hierarchy: Bare metal physical machines, Virtual Machines, MicroVMs, Containers, Isolates, & Functions. This fundamentally changes how distributed data platforms and data-intensive applications will be developed. This talk outlines the architectural building blocks that can be used in specific design patterns for developing modern distributed data platforms. We will draw from our experiences in developing a prominent distributed data analytics platform, Apache Hadoop, and outline how such a platform could be built today with modern building blocks. We intend to cover most aspects of the platform control planes such as high availability, disaster recovery, security, resource scheduling, orchestration, resource isolation, allocation, management, monitoring, scaling, metrics, metering, and logging. I will illustrate this architectural paradigm shift with some of the design choices we have made at Ampool, a modern data analytics platform.

              .section-schedule-item__right--text
                p Knowledge Logic is a system of logic that provides a framework for what it means to "know" something, or how to deduce "I know that you know that I know". This has far-reaching implications for everything from distributed systems to politics to navigating traffic. This talk is a gentle introduction to the topic, and will leave you with the knowhow to topple dicators.
